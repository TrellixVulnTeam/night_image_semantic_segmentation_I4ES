# night_image_semantic_segmentation
This is the official github repository for the paper "What's There in The Dark" accepted in IEEE International Conference in Image Processing 2019 (ICIP19) , Taipei, Taiwan.

Since we are submitting in journal, we currently cannot make the code public, however, we are making the data preparation code public. Infact we are the first one to make the model for day to night image conversion public.
